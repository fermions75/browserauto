Hey there! I’m Diana, Head of Sales and Marketing at Investera, where I’m committed to driving growth, innovation, and transformative results in the investment management space. Recently featured in Forbes, my work is all about pushing boundaries, building powerful partnerships, and creating a lasting impact across the GCC and beyond.

In my role at Investera, I’m not just connecting with clients; I’m reshaping the way they approach their investment strategies. I bring an acute understanding of market dynamics and a relentless focus on aligning our solutions with clients’ needs. My goal? To ensure that every partnership we forge and every solution we deliver is a step forward for both our clients and the industry at large.

Outside of work, I live for experiences that inspire me to think differently. As a digital nomad, I’ve embraced the freedom to work across cultures and landscapes, which gives me a fresh, adaptable perspective. My passions—whether it’s the rhythm of contemporary dance or the thrill of surfing—teach me resilience, balance, and the value of going all in.

With a sharp eye on the future and a drive to unlock potential, I’m here to make waves in investment management and connect with those who are equally committed to breaking new ground.

Bander Al-Omrani, passionate about
 the logistics and fintech sectors, with four years of hands-on experience building the logistics app Dandon.
Through this journey, I discovered a major gap and lack of trust between wholesalers and retailers caused by the unorganized consignment sales model.
Today, we are launching TMAHA, a platform designed to solve this challenge at scale, and we welcome serious investors and partners to join us on this journey.
TMAHA enables retailers to access inventory with ease and without liquidity pressure, while ensuring wholesalers’ rights through secured collection systems and direct integration with POS.
The platform provides real-time transparency in financial flows, strengthening trust and making the market more stable and faster to scale.

At TMAHA, our vision is to become the smartest infrastructure for consignment sales in the region, attracting strategic partners and investors who believe in the power of deep fintech innovation to build more transparent and scalable markets.

As the CEO of a leading company in these sectors, I focus on integrating advanced technologies with innovative investment strategies to create a real impact in the market.

One of the most significant projects I'm proud of is ""Gamma Assets,"" a venture aimed at revolutionizing the world of asset tokenization. By leveraging blockchain technology, we are able to fractionalize real estate assets into smaller units that can be easily traded among investors. This process opens up investment opportunities to a broader range of investors, previously limited to large-scale players, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in asset management.

At the upcoming exhibition, my goal is to build new relationships and expand my professional network with partners and investors interested in fintech. We are actively planning to introduce the ""Gamma Assets"" project to Saudi Arabia, one of the leading countries in the fintech space. I believe the Saudi market holds tremendous potential, and our project can play a crucial role in advancing the digital transformation of the real estate investment sector there.

This initiative is part of our broader strategy to expand into new markets, and we are excited about the opportunities that await us in Saudi Arabia to drive innovation in asset tokenization and realize our vision of making markets more transparent and efficient for everyone",CONNECTED_TWO_WAY,kamiran@gammauniverse.io,False,CEO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamiranhalil/,"{'formattedNumber': '+90 536 777 98 01', '__typename': 'Core_PhoneNumber'}",Kamiran Halil,GAMMA UNIVERSE TEKNOLOJİ VE TİCARET LİMİTED ŞİRKETİ,RXZlbnRQZW9wbGVfNDEzMDU0Mjc=,gammaassets.com

With over 15 years of entrepreneurial experience and a diverse professional background, I have committed my career to addressing critical challenges faced by women, offering innovative, accessible, and impactful solutions.  

Professional Journey  
I began my career as a fashion designer, where I honed my creative problem-solving skills and developed a deep understanding of women’s needs. Over the years, my expertise expanded into technology, digital marketing, and wellness. With certifications in web design, digital marketing, and Google platforms, I leveraged my multidisciplinary skills to establish ventures that reflect my passion for empowering women and driving social impact.  

Super Nisa emerged as a response to the pressing need for accessible, high-quality solutions for women’s health and hygiene. Our platform offers products and services that ensure women have the tools they need to lead healthier, more confident lives.  

Vision and Mission
At Super Nisa, our mission is simple yet profound: to empower women by providing convenient, anytime-anywhere solutions for their health and hygiene needs. By combining technology with empathy, we aim to remove the stigma around feminine health and create a platform where women feel supported and celebrated.  

As a woman entrepreneur, I understand the challenges faced by women in society, from limited access to resources to the lack of platforms addressing their specific needs. Super Nisa is more than a business; it is a movement to foster a culture of care, awareness, and inclusivity.  

Accomplishments and Recognition
Throughout my journey, I have had the privilege of being recognized for my work. Some notable achievements include:  
- Being the Founder and CEO of Superwomen Pakistan, a platform amplifying women’s voices.  
- Winning prestigious awards like the **APICTA Gold Award**, **Pasha Gold Award**, and more.  
- Representing women-led startups on platforms like **BBC** and receiving accolades for my entrepreneurial efforts.  
- Collaborating with international and national organizations to create a sustainable impact in the women’s wellness sector.  

Future Goals
As I look ahead, my focus is on scaling Super Nisa to a global level, particularly in the MENA region, where access to women-centric solutions remains limited. My goal is to forge strategic partnerships with local investors and partners who share the same passion for empowering women. Together, we can create an ecosystem where women thrive, not just survive.  

Call to Action
I am seeking collaborators, investors, and visionaries who resonate with Super Nisa’s mission to support and uplift women. By joining hands, we can ensure every woman has access to the care and tools she needs to lead a healthier, more dignified life.

Born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, I embarked on a journey fueled by a relentless passion for technology and a vision for transformative change. From my earliest days, I was drawn to the intricate world of software development, and my journey has since evolved into a testament to the power of innovation and leadership.

My journey began with a foundational education in software engineering, where I honed my technical skills and fostered a deep understanding of computer science principles. Armed with a degree from Prince Sultan University, I embarked on a quest to explore the endless possibilities of technology.

As a lead developer, I immersed myself in the intricacies of technology, pushing boundaries and driving innovation at every turn. This pivotal role not only honed my technical prowess but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the power of collaboration and teamwork.

Driven by a desire to leverage technology for societal good, I ventured into the realm of fintech, our company co-created groundbreaking joint ventures licensed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA). These ventures, born from a fusion of technical expertise and visionary leadership, have redefined the financial landscape, bringing cutting-edge solutions to the forefront of innovation.

My journey is a testament to the transformative power of leadership and innovation. From my humble beginnings as a lead developer to my role in spearheading joint ventures licensed by SAMA, I have embraced every challenge as an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, and drive positive change.

As I reflect on my journey thus far, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that have shaped my career. Looking ahead, I remain steadfast in my commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation, driving positive change, and leaving a lasting legacy in the world of technology and beyond.

My autobiography is a testament to the power of perseverance, passion, and unwavering determination. From my early days as a lead developer to my role in creating joint ventures licensed by SAMA, I have embraced every challenge as an opportunity to innovate, inspire, and make a meaningful impact on the world around me.
